            <p id="pTaurus">The sign of Taurus is associated with several myths and bull worship from several ancient cultures. It was the first sign of the zodiac established among the Mesopotamians, who called it "The Great Bull of Heaven," as it was the constellation through which the Sun rose on the vernal equinox at that time,[3] that is the Early Bronze Age, from about 4000 BC to 1700 BC.</p>

            <p id="pLeo">Leos are the natural leaders of the zodiac, as magnificent and striking as the Lion that embodies their sign. Leos are radiantly joyful, liberal with their appeal and endowments. They are fiercely proud and confident. They love and live life to the fullest rather than being in charge at home, work, and play.</p>
