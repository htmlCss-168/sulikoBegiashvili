            <p>The sign of Taurus is associated with several myths and bull worship from several ancient cultures. It was the first sign of the zodiac established among the Mesopotamians, who called it "The Great Bull of Heaven," as it was the constellation through which the Sun rose on the vernal equinox at that time,[3] that is the Early Bronze Age, from about 4000 BC to 1700 BC.</p>

            <p>Egyptians worshipped the constellation, which they referred to as "Knem", because it was present during the flooding of the Nile River. This event signified plentiful harvests for the upcoming year, and the people interpreted it as a gift from the earth. Ruler of Egypt, Tutankhamun's gold throne features lion heads where the seat and front legs meet, as well as clawed feet at the end of each leg, symbolizing power and royalty.[5]</p>

            <p>Scorpio is one of the water signs, the others being Cancer and Pisces.It is a fixed, negative sign.Scorpio is associated with three different animals: the scorpion, the snake, and the eagle.According to The Astrology Bible, Scorpio's colors are deep red, maroon, black, and brown.</p>
